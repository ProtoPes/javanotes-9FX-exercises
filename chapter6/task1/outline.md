# What I need to do

Use code from `DragWithTrail.java` and `SimplePaint.java` to write a program that
will draw different figures with the left click of the mouse depending on `shift` key is
pressed or not. If the user drag the mouse while the left mouse key is pressed, program
will draw the figure along the way. If the right mouse key is pressed, canvas should be
cleared.
