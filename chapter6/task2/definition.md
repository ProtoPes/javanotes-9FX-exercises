Write a program that shows a small red square and a small blue square. The user should be
able to drag either square with the mouse. (Youâ€™ll need an instance variable to remember
which square the user is dragging.) The user can drag the square out of the window if she
wants, and it will disappear. To allow the user to get the squares back into the window,
add a KeyPressed event handler that will restore the squares to their original positions
when the user presses the Escape key. The key code for the Escape key is KeyCode.ESCAPE.
