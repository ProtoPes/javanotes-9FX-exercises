Differences:

- I set all event listeners on scene, they put on scene only keyboard event
- They used "offset" (the coordinates of mouse click according to the top left
corner of the figure), I changed the positions of figures according to mouse movements.
- They used one boolean fore dragging toggling and another boolean for determine which
figure is selected. I decided to use one int variable for this(0 - no figure, 1 and 2 
represents selected figures.
