In Exercise 6.3, you wrote a graphical pair-of-dice program where the dice are rolled when
the user clicks on the canvas. Now make a pair-of-dice program where the user rolls the
dice by clicking a button. The button should appear under the canvas that shows the
dice. Also make the following change: When the dice are rolled, instead of just showing
the new value, show a short animation during which the values on the dice are changed in
every frame. The animation is supposed to make the dice look more like they are actually
rolling.
