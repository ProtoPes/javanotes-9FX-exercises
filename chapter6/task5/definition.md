In Exercise 3.8, you drew a checkerboard. For this exercise, write a program where the user
can select a square by clicking on it. Highlight the selected square by drawing a colored
border around it. When the program starts, no square is selected. When the user clicks
on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected, and the previously selected
square, if any, is unselected. If the user clicks the square that is selected, it becomes
unselected. Assume that the size of the checkerboard is exactly 400 by 400 pixels, so that
each square on the checkerboard is 50 by 50 pixels.
